# People interested in speaking at React Native Online Meetup:

## Leland Richardson

### Bio
Work on React Native @ Airbnb

### Outline
I can talk about our navigation library, as well as anything else that we are doing at Airbnb that
people are interested in, for example some of the responses to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/intelligibabble/status/788249703737458689).

## Sonny Lazuardi

### Bio
Work on React Native @ Sale Stock

### Outline
I can talk about code sharing between our android app and web app using React Native Web. I can also talk about versioner (like codepush) and how we do automatic update for our react native android app.

## Alexey Kureev

### Bio
React Native ronin @ OSS

### Outline
I can talk about JS - Native bridge. For instance, I can explain what actually happens once you call `AppRegistry.registerComponent` and how your React tree maps to the real native UI you see on a device.

## Truls Skeie

### Bio
Work at Routes.guide and as a Consultant.

### Outline
At Routes.guide we have a webapp, and a RN (React-native) ios and Android app. I can talk about code sharing between the webapp and the native apps.
I can also talk about the challenges of using RN to develop for both Android and iOS.

As a consultant I’ve been working on a calling app (app-to-app and app-to-[PSTN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network]).
This is just for Android. For this project we have written a couple of native modules for Android I can possible talk about that. We have also written a little bit of the UI in plain Java / Android (XML). So I can talk about how we share data between this (even though I don’t think we have solved it elegantly I would love to get some feedback and tell why we did what we did).

I've worked with RN for the past 1.5 years and I had zero experience in developing native Android and iOS apps before RN.

## Preethi Kasireddy

### Bio
Work on React @ Coinbase and React Native for side projects/OSS

### Outline
TBD: Available after 12/1

## Claudéric Demers

### Bio
Work on React Native apps @ Nirvana & @ PeopleLikeUs

### Outline
I can talk about the challenges of migrating React components that rely heavily on user interaction to React Native (for example, the differences between `PanResponder` vs event listeners, `Animated` vs CSS transitions/animations, sortable+swipeable `ListView`, `LayoutAnimation`, etc). For the past 6 months, I've been working on migrating a Cordova based app built with React to React Native. I can speak about some of the challenges that have presented themselves during this journey and how we've managed to solve them.

I'm also currently working on migrating some of my open source projects to React Native (namely, `react-infinite-calendar` and `react-sortable-hoc`), and can also talk about that process and the challenges it's presented.

## Mike Grabowski

### Bio
I am a CTO @ Callstack.io and React Native contributor by night

### Outline
I can talk about everything related to React Native (releases, native modules) and everything we do at Callstack, which includes the way we work, our open source activities and plans for open sourcing next frameworks and tools that we use internally

### Outline
I am a co-author of NativeBase (OpenSource) - Essential cross-platform UI component library for React Native. It is being used by many React Native developers in production. I can talk about how we came up with the idea of NativeBase and how we developed the set of UI components. I would shed some light on how you can use it for your next project to ease the development and move faster with your idea.

### Outline
Ignite is a generator for boilerplate code in React Native.  Even though it currently comes with a kitchen sink of best practices, it's growing and evolving into a dynamic system that will work with numerous other tools.  See where it is, and what it provides today, as well as how it can benefit your open library in the future.
