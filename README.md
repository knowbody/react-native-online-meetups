#REACT NATIVE ONLINE MEETUPS

"So I came with this crazy idea about doing online meetups on React Native."

-> [Mateusz Zatorski](https://twitter.com/matzatorski), Nov 2016 <-

### How it works, basically:

1. Every month or so, we get 4-5 speakers per meetup.
2. Every session will last around for an hour.
3. I mainly would like to see what people are working on, whether it's a library, side project app, or some hack you want to share with others.
4. Meetups will be live streamed and recorded.
5. More to follow, stay tuned!

## UPCOMING MEETUPS

The second meetup is going to be on Wednesday, Feb 15th at 17.30 GMT.

The speakers line-up will include:
* [Gant Laborde](https://twitter.com/GantLaborde)
* [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3)
* [Kumar Sanket](https://twitter.com/sanketsahu)

And [Franzé Júnior](https://twitter.com/GantLaborde) will host.

This time the tool used will be [BigMarker](https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup/React-Native-Remote-Meetup-1).

See you there!

I knew that was not the best time for all of the timezones, but we promise to improve later based on the attendees.


## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
### As a speaker
If you're interested in being among the speakers, send a PR of `interestedSpeakers.md` with your name, a short bio/contact and the outline of what you'd like to talk about.

For each new session an issue will be created, like [this](https://github.com/knowbody/react-native-online-meetups/issues/29), in order to define 3-4 speakers that will partecipate.

### As a non-speaker
During the meetup you'll be able to talk with the speakers and the other spectators via some tool (first time it was Sli.Do and YouTube Live chat, for the second we'll try BigMarker).

If you'd like to hear about a certain topic, send a PR of `suggestedTopics.md`.

**In any case**, since the project is still evolving, feel free to open Issues to propose ideas and provide feedbacks!
