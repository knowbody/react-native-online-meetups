# REACT NATIVE ONLINE MEETUPS

"So I came with this crazy idea about doing online meetups on React Native."

-> [Mateusz Zatorski](https://twitter.com/matzatorski), Nov 2016 <-

### How it works, basically:

1. Every month or so, we get 3-4 speakers per meetup.
2. Every session will last around for an hour.
3. We would like to see what people are working on, whether it's a library, side project app, or some hack you want to share with others.
4. Meetups will be live streamed and recorded.
5. More to follow, stay tuned!

## UPCOMING MEETUPS

The next meetup (\#2) date is April 7th, at 6pm GMT.

The speakers line-up will include:
* [Parashuram](https://twitter.com/nparashuram)
* [Kumar Sanket](https://twitter.com/sanketsahu)
* [Peter Piekarczyk](https://twitter.com/peterpme)

[Franzé Júnior](https://twitter.com/franzejr) will host, and we will be using [BigMarker](https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup) as platform - you can sign up for this session [here](https://www.bigmarker.com/remote-meetup/React-Native-Remote-Meetup-2).

The best way to keep up-to-date is to follow the hosts on twitter or watch this repository.

See you there!

It's hard to find a date & time ideal for everyone, we try to improve every time based on attendees.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
### As a speaker
If you're interested in being among the speakers, send a PR of `interestedSpeakers.md` with your name, a short bio/contact and the outline of what you'd like to talk about.

For each new session an issue will be created, like [this](https://github.com/knowbody/react-native-online-meetups/issues/29), in order to define 3-4 speakers that will partecipate.

### As a non-speaker
During the meetup you'll be able to talk with the speakers and the other spectators via chat and Q&A tools (first time it was Sli.Do and YouTube Live chat, for the second was BigMarker).

If you'd like to hear about a certain topic, send a PR of `suggestedTopics.md`.
